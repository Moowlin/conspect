### What is Linux
Linux is operating system software that runs on a hardware computer system. 
An operating system is software that allows other programs like word processors and web browsers to be installed and run on a computer.
The Linux command-line is a text-based interface that accepts commands that you type into it. These commands cause an action to be executed onto the computer system’s operating system.
the command-line is often the hero when it comes to system administration and troubleshooting as it gives a clear picture of what the system is doing at any given moment.
